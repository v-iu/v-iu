# Hi I'm Fredriech

I am currently a 3rd Year CS Student @ Asia Pacific College

## About Me

I am currently following the learning track of data science & analytics, ML and AI Engineering. I have experience with Python, SQL, and data structures. 

I also plan to learn voxels and create my dream video game with it (eventually). 

I love philosophical stuff and am disciplined in work.
